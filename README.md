Donation Percentage Calculation: The project calculates the percentage of donations made compared to a predefined total (in this case, 12 donations). It displays this percentage as "Donated" and "Remaining," providing users with a clear understanding of the current donation progress.

Interactive Pie Chart: Although you requested to remove it, the project initially included an interactive pie chart that visually represents the donation percentages. Users can see the proportions of donations made and remaining at a glance.

Local Storage Integration: The project utilizes the browser's local storage to store and retrieve donation data. This allows users to revisit the page and see the updated donation statistics, even after closing the browser or refreshing the page.
